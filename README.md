Step 1: Clone the Git Repository

    Open your terminal.

    Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Git repository using the cd command.

    Clone the repository using the following command:


    git clone <repository_url>

Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

    Use the cd command to move into the cloned project directory:


    cd <project_directory>

Step 3: Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)

    Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

Step 4: Install Project Dependencies

    In the project directory, install the project dependencies with:


    npm install

Step 5: Create a .env File

    Rename the .env.example file to .env.
    Fill in the missing values in the .env file.

Step 6: Start the Development Server

    Start the development server using Vite:


    npm run dev

Step 7: Access Your React App

    Once the development server is running, open your web browser and go to the provided URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:5173/) to see your React app in action.

Remember to replace placeholders like <repository_url> and your_api_key with actual values.

Note that specific commands and steps might vary based on your project structure, setup, and potential tool updates. Always refer to the official documentation of Vite, React, and other relevant tools for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
